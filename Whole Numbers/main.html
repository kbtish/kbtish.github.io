            We continued today with <span>division</span>, this time using a
            <span>multi-digit divisor</span>.  We will still get some remainders.
            <br />
            The key thing to know about this kind of division is that we will often have to
            <span>guess and check</span> on questions like "How many times does 17 go into 124?"
            <br /><br />

            Today we started looking at <span>subtraction</span>.  Some important things to remember are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The order of the numbers is important ("3 minus 1" is NOT the same as "1 minus 3")
                    <br />&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    For multi-digit subtraction, we start in the ones place and work our way left.
                    <br />For example, to do 347 - 182, we would start with 7 - 2
                    <br />&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the bottom digit is bigger than the top digit, we need to <span>borrow/regroup</span>
                    <br />&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can <span>check our answer</span> by adding
                    <br />
                    For example, 34 - 15 = 19 ... Check the answer by adding ... 15 + 19 = 34
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Be careful if you are <span>borrowing from a zero</span>, (also called
            "subtracting across zeros").
            <br /><br />
            Here's a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCWfLrLirKQ' target='_blank'>
                video
            </a>
            that shows you how to borrow from zeros.
            <br /><br /><br />
            We also covered <span>subtraction word problems</span>.  A subtraction word problem usually involves:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    separating things
                </li>
                <li>
                    taking something away
                </li>

            We looked at <span>addition</span> today.  Some important things to know include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When adding multi-digit numbers, start in the ones place and work your way to the left
                    <br />(For example, when adding 26 + 37, we would start with 6 + 7)
                    <br />&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the result you get is a two-digit number, write down the number from the ones place
                    and <span>carry</span> the number from the tens place.  This is also called
                    <span>regrouping</span>.
                    <br />(For example, to add 26 + 37, we would start with 6 + 7, which
                    is 13... write down the 3 and carry the 1).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <span>Addition word problems</span> will usually involve:
            <ul>
                <li>putting things together</li>
                <li>combining things</li>
                <li>things that should be counted together</li>
            </ul>
            Watch out for <span>extra information</span> that you do not need, for example, information about oranges
            in a problem that asks about apples.

            Today we work on <span>place value</span> as well as writing numbers as <span>numerals</span>

            We will start studying addition next week, but for now, it is very
